### Interests
* Video Games
* Artificial Intelligence
* Computers
* Software
* Coding in Python

## Technical background
My programming experience includes ~2-3 years of Java experience, ~1.5 years of Python experience, and ~1 year of C experience. I have used many different utilities like GitHub, Windows Subsystem for Linux, Bash scripting, etc. My favorite programming language, and one that I prefer programming in is Python, though I am fully comfortable with programming in Java if the situation calls for it. I have experienced Unity in the past, though I would not call myself experienced enough in C# to consider making anything in it. I would have to learn the framework first.
