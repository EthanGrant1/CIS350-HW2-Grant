## Technical Background
My programming experience includes ~2-3 years of Java experience, ~1.5 years of Python experience and ~1 year of C experience. I have used many different utilities like Github, Windows Subsystem for Linux, Bash scripting, etc. My favorite programming language to program in is Python, but I am also very comfortable working in Java if the situation requires it. I have experienced Unity in the past, but I am not very familiar with the framework, and would have to have a much greater amount of experience with C# to consinder it as useful.
